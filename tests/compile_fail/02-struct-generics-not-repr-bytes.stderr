   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following traits define an item `zero`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
           candidate #1: `ReprBytes`
           candidate #2: `bit_vec::BitBlock`
           candidate #3: `zerocopy::FromZeroes`
